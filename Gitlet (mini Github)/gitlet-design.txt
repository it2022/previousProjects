I started with a simple sorting set algorithm

Classes and Data Structures
---------------------------
sets
arrays
trees
lists
hashmaps
iterators
commits
paths
removal

Algorithms
----------

bts
djistrikas
a star
quick sort
sorting

Persistence
-----------
i need to work first on making my classes
then i'll do the data structures
then i'll do the functions
then i'll figure out the algorithms
then i'll do troubleshooting
then i'll do error checks
then i'll do the debugging
then i'll do the rest
